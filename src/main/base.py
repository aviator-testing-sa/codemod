I'll review the code for any SQLAlchemy 1.4 to 2.1 migration issues.

Looking at the provided code, I don't see any SQLAlchemy-related code that would need to be migrated. This file contains:

1. A Flask context processor that injects parameters into templates
2. A helper function for image paths
3. A date formatting function

None of these functions use SQLAlchemy directly, so no changes are needed for the SQLAlchemy 1.4 to 2.1 migration.
